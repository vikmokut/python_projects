# Python Projects
Learning and exploring python - all projects in this repo were inspired by the need to put my new skills to practice.

Some project highlights include:

* Grocery_app: With full CRUD functionality and absolutely ZERO default libraries.
I did my best to come up with the CRUD functonality solutions from scratch.

* Mnemonic_app: This beauty simply takes a user's name then creates a mnemonic from each letter.
Every new attempt comes up with a different result (using the python random module).
I also included the rough list of words I got from the internet and a function I wrote to clean up the trash.
